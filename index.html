    <h1>Team Info</h1>
    <article>
        <p>For the 2025 season, the New England Patriots have a 11-2 record. The team has made significant improvement since last years season when their record was 4-13, the worst it had been in years. There has been a major improvement in the Patriots playing style since head coach Mike Vrabel joined the organization for the 2025 season. Vrabel was a Patriot himself from 2001-2008, playing as a linebacker. Being a Patriots fan my entire life, I am happy to finally see the Patriots back on a winning streak and we have a good change of making it to the playoffs. It was embarrassing to see Gillette stadium half empty last season due to how bad our team was playing. Mike Vrable knows the organization well and brings a good energy to the team, keeping players motivated and doing a great job coaching. </p>
        
        <p>Now that I've covered some basic information on how the team is doing for the 2025 season, I'd like to go over some of the team history since the start back in 1960. The team was started November 22, 1959 when a businessman based out of Boston, Billy Sullivan Jr., purchased a American Football League (AFL) franchise. When the team was looking for a name, "Patriots" was chosen due to New England's heritage. The team was originally called the "Boston Patriots" and the name was changed to the "New England Patriots" in 1971. The Patriots lost their first game against the Denver Broncos 13-10 in 1960. During the early years of the Patriots, they didn't have a permanant stadium. They played at the Boston University field from 1960-1961, Harvard in 1962, Fenway park from 1963-1969 and at Harvard again in 1970. It wasn't until 1971 that it was announced the Patriots would move to Foxboro, where a new 60,000+ seat stadium had been built for the team called Schafer Stadium. Schafer stadium was renamed to Sullivan stadium and later Foxboro stadium. The stadium served as the Patriots home field for years up until 2002, when Gillette Stadium was built.</p>

        <p>The current owner of the Patriots, Robert Kraft, bought the team in 1994 for $172 million dollars. Kraft had leverage to buy the team from James Orthwein because when Kraft bought Sullivan stadium in 1988, the purchase also included the lease that the Patriots had with the stadium. Orthwein wanted to move the Patriots to St. Louis, but Kraft refused to let the Patriots break the lease that ran through 2001 in order for the team to do so. This put Orthwein in a tough spot because he wanted the Patriots to be closer to where he lived in Missouri, but he had no way to make it happen without breaking the lease with Sullivan Stadium and potentially face huge lawsuits. This put Kraft in an ideal spot to buy the team because he knew that Orthwein had no desire to keep the Patriots in New England. Kraft then offered $172 million to buy the Patriots in 1994, the most money that had been offered to purchase an NFL team at the time. Orthwein accepted the offer because he knew he would be unable to relocate the team and Krafts offer to buy the Patriots was to large to turn down. Kraft wanted to purchase the Patriots because he had been a lifelong fan of the team and saw long term potential if the team stayed in New England. Kraft hired Bill Belichick on January 27, 2000 as the teams head coach. Tom Brady was then drafted in November of 2000 and played his first game as a starting quarterback in 2001 against the Indianapolis Colts, starting the Brady-Belichick dynasty that everyone knows today.</p>

    <h1>Gillette Stadium</h1>

    <p>Constuction on Gillette stadium started in 2000 and was built to replace the aging Foxboro stadium. Construction on Gillette stadium completed in 2002 and the stadium held it's first game against the Pittsburg Steelers. The Patriots won this game 30 - 14. The total cost for building the stadium was $350 million and the project had been financed privatly, which was unusual for the time. The stadium was originally called CMGI Field before the Gillette razor company bought the rights to the stadium shortly after the stadium opened in 2002. Gillette extended their contract to keep their name on the stadium in 2010.</p>

    <p>Gillette Stadium was designed with a open-air feel to allow fans to not feel cramped. Gillette also features improved sightlines so fans have a better angle of watching the game instead of having a hard time seeing what is going on during the game. Gillette also has updated concession so fans are able to find their favorite food and drink at the stadium while enjoying the game. Gillette was also built to feature luxury suites unlike the old Foxboro stadium, and also features club seating, which is another ammenity that was not present at the old Foxboro stadium. This makes the stadium more finacially profitable when compared to the revenue that Foxboro stadium brought in. Gillette stadium has a seating capacity of 65,878 which is an increase of around 5,000 seats when compared to the capacity of Foxboro stadium. Gillette stadium is also used for other events, most commonly concerts, when the Patriots are not playing on the field.</p>
