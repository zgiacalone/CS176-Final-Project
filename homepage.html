    <h1>Team Info</h1>
    <article>
        <p>For the 2025 season, the New England Patriots have a 9-2 record. The team has made significant improvement since last years season when their record was 4-13, the worst it had been in years. There has been a major improvement in the Patriots playing style since head coach Mike Vrabel joined the organization for the 2025 season. Vrabel was a Patriot himself from 2001-2008, playing as a linebacker. Being a Patriots fan my entire life, I am happy to finally see the Patriots back on a winning streak and we have a good change of making it to the playoffs. It was embarrassing to see Gilette stadium half empty last season due to how bad our team was playing. Mike Vrable knows the organization well and brings a good energy to the team, keeping players motivated and doing a great job coaching. </p>
        
        <p>Now that I've covered some basic information on how the team is doing for the 2025 season, I'd like to go over some of the team history since the start back in 1960. The team was started November 22, 1959 when a businessman based out of Boston, Billy Sullivan Jr., purchased a American Football League (AFL) franchise. When the team was looking for a name, "Patriots" was chosen due to New England's heritage. The team was originally called the "Boston Patriots" and the name was changed to the "New England Patriots" in 1971. The Patriots lost their first game against the Denver Broncos 13-10 in 1960. During the early years of the Patriots, they didn't have a permanant stadium. They played at the Boston University field from 1960-1961, Harvard in 1962, Fenway park from 1963-1969 and at Harvard again in 1970. It wasn't until 1971 that it was announced the Patriots would move to Foxboro, where a new 60,000+ seat stadium had been built for the team called Schafer Stadium. </p>
